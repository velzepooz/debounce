# Implement debounce decorator

[DEMO LINK](https://github.com/velzepooz/debounce/tree/gh-pages)

* It takes a function and a delay as arguments and returns a wrapper function
* The original function should be called only after a given delay in wrapper calls
* Test your implementation with the debounced input
* Nothing appears while you are typing
* If you stop for at least a second there should be only last value printed into console
* (*) pass a correct this into the original function if you can (uncomment it in the code)
